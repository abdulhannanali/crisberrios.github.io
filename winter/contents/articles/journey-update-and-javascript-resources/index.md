This week, I hit a milestone in my journey as we [finished our first nonprofit project](http://crisberrios.github.io/articles/kopernik-first-nonprofit-experience-at-freecodecamp/) at FCC. So, until the next project arrives the study goes on, and here's a recap of what I've learned this past two weeks.

##Focus Switch

Since I've been getting a little more confident with my JavaScript skills, I started moving from a 100% pure JavaScript approach to learning some practical skills alongside JS. Nonetheless, it's still about 40% pure JS and 60% other things including frameworks, which are (mostly) 100% JS, so JS is still a big part of my daily study. I've also started doing some personal projects: there's a small static site I'm building for a family member (which in turn helped me [streamline my frontend workflow](https://github.com/crisberrios/static-starter)) and another small CRUD project using React and Backbone.

##Resources ahoy!

To keep the post short, here's a compilation of the best resources I've read and watched this past 2 weeks:

####Books

- [You Don't Know JS: Scope & Closures](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/tree/master/scope%20%26%20closures) This book series is awesome and I'm looking forward to reading the rest of the series.
- [Developing Backbone.js Applications](http://addyosmani.github.io/backbone-fundamentals/) This book by Addy Osmani is very good to start learning Backbone, and also free online.
- [Backbone.js Blueprints](https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/backbonejs-blueprints) free with a Tutsplus subscription, it's also very good since it guides you through many projects using Backbone.
- [Functional JavaScript](http://jcouyang.gitbooks.io/functional-javascript/content/en/index.html) a small book with good content about functional JavaScript.


####Courses
- [Introduction to TypeScript](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-typescript-microsoft-dev201x) Free from Microsoft, why not?
- [MongoDB for Node.js Developers](https://university.mongodb.com/courses/M101JS/about) Very good, verified and free. A must for new JS developers
- [Getting Started with Backbone.js](https://code.tutsplus.com/courses/getting-started-with-backbone) the most updated introductory course to Backbone.js. A bit condensed but great after reading Addy's book.
- [Getting Started with React.js](https://code.tutsplus.com/courses/getting-started-with-reactjs) A very good intro to React.js


####Blog posts

- [The Symmetry of JavaScript Functions](http://raganwald.com/2015/03/12/symmetry.html) by Ragan Wald. No need to say anything else.
- [Web Development & Design Tools](https://dannyfritz.wordpress.com/2015/02/03/web-development-design-tools-january-2015/) Nice post by our fellow "senior camper" Danny Fritz. Went through all the links, some really nice finds!
- [Avoid Side Effects with Immutable Data Structures](http://bahmutov.calepin.co/avoid-side-effects-with-immutable-data-structures.html) The title says it all. Recommended reading.
- [Building Apps with PureScript and React](https://kritzcreek.github.io/tutorial/2015/03/31/apps-with-purescript-and-react-1/) by a fellow camper, I'm really looking forward to see the rest of this series.
- [Enough With the Salts: Updates on Secure Password Schemes](http://chargen.matasano.com/chargen/2015/3/26/enough-with-the-salts-updates-on-secure-password-schemes.html) Good read on password schemes.
- [Shipping Node.js Applications with Docker and Codeship](http://blog.risingstack.com/shipping-node-js-applications-with-docker-and-codeship/)
