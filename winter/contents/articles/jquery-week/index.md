Last week, I came (again) to the realization that my online portfolio was null, zero, *void 0*, nada, so I decided to challenge myself and commit one little project each day during 7 days using a versatile, widely used and easy to learn library that I've never explored before starting [FreeCodeCamp](http://www.freecodecamp.com). That library is, of course, **jQuery**.

##Getting Ideas

![jQuery](jquery-logo.png)

For project ideas, I already had some ideas in mind, but I wanted to go a little off-the track from the major typical examples like a slider or a modal window. I also wanted them to be made "from scratch", so no "make your own xxx with jQuery" YouTube or blog tutorials. The setup was simple. 1st: open CodePen 2nd: start to code.

##Strenghtening the basics

 In parallel, I've also been reading a lot, going through every article, video, book and link on this [Gist](https://gist.github.com/ericelliott/d576f72441fc1b27dace) by Eric Elliot. It really gives you a good path for learning JavaScript properly. I'm still missing many books and links reommended there, but I can recommend them 100%.

Furthermore, this week I learned about **Reactive Functional Programming**, which is a totally new paradigm from my classic *C* background, and from mostly all the JS I've learned up until now. It got me super excited and made me want to refactor everything using it, so one of the projects I made uses [BaconJS](https://baconjs.github.io/) as a proof of concept, and it also plays very nice with jQuery. Totally mindblown.

##Just do it!

**So I went on and made 7 pens this week**. No frills, no struggle, that's it. Just dedicated 1 hour or 2 each day and went on with my self-imposed challenge. Wrapping it up, I learned many new things about jQuery and the DOM (like requestAnimationFrame), I had lots of fun doing the projects, and beefed up my frontend portfolio for good measure. I hope you like the projects/pens, and if you are starting from 0 like me, gives you some motivation to start your own challenge.

Of course, here's **The Link** to [my Codepen](http://codepen.io/crisberrios/). Enjoy!

UPDATE:

I've read about this girl who made 180 websites in 180 days. Quite a feat! and even some sites are very simple, she had the constance to never stop doing it. [Here's the site](http://jenniferdewalt.com/index.html)
