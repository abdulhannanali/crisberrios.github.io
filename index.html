                <p>Welcome to my coding-related (and only) personal website. I'm Cristián, and along with my wife we decided to leave our country in search of new adventures.</p>
                <p>Currently, we live in Mexico City, and a mix of factors including low salaries and painfully long distances, led me to the decision of switching careers and becoming a full-time software engineer</p>

                <section><p>So here I am. Living in the outskirts of Mexico City while learning how to <em>properly</em> code and become a full stack web developer with the help of <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org">Free Code Camp</a> online&nbsp;bootcamp.</p>
<p>What was I doing before this? Well, this isn’t my first coding experience, nor my first web-dev experience. I <em>used to be</em> (since I’m switching careers) an electronics engineer, and I’ve done some nice and interesting projects, mostly related with <strong><span class="caps">M2M</span></strong> and <strong>Fleet Management</strong> services, coding firmware for embedded devices and making scripts for data&nbsp;terminals.</p>
<p>Also, I’ve participated in the design and implementation of a variety of Wordpress sites/blogs, static <span class="caps">HTML</span> sites and worked as SEO/SEM manager for small businesses as my hobby side&nbsp;job.</p>
<p>But I never took the time to properly learn JavaScript, <span class="caps">CSS</span>, and HTML (HTML5 was a new thing for me). Mostly hacking some scripts here and there, copy-pasting some PHP to make a plug-in work and inline-css-ing to fix some&nbsp;details.</p>
<p>What changed? Well, ever since I met my wife, we have been spending our savings not in a mortgage, or even a car. We have been <strong>travelling</strong> (not as much as you think, but one of our dreams was visiting Japan), and somewhere along the road we decided we should get out of our country and be on the move, in search of new adventures and a better quality of&nbsp;life.</p>
<p>First step: finding a stable job in another country. Since my wife’s work is in the academic field, that meant her getting a PhD first or me finding a job in another country. And that leads us&nbsp;to…</p>
